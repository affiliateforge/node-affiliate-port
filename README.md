# Node Affiliate port

Welcome to our Affiliate Port Node.js Monorepo! This project aims to streamline the integration of various CPA (Cost Per Action) networks into your applications. We leverage the power of Nx for efficient monorepo management and follow industry-standard practices such as conventional commits and maintaining a high test coverage.

## Features

## Conventional Commits

We follow the conventional commits specification, which allows for a consistent and structured commit history. Each commit should have a type, scope, and a short description. For example:

- `feat(admitad): add authentication endpoint`
- `fix(admitad): handle error in order processing`

Refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for more details.

## Test Coverage

Maintaining a high test coverage is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of our codebase. We aim to keep our unit test coverage above 80%, ensuring that most of our code resides in the "green zone".
